# About

Hi, my name is Fabio. I'm passionate about all things related to hardware,
software, programming languages, and distributed systems. As a home lab
enthusiast, I also enjoy running my own infrastructure.

Professionally I am a principal architect with focus on complex distributed
systems leveraging Kafka and a variety of different data stores like Redis,
MySQL, OpenSearch, and Databricks. I use this space as a conduit to express my
interests and creativity about embedded systems, hardware design, and low level
programming that I don't get to do on my day job.

I was motivated to start blogging after a few insights from a couple of podcasts
that I listened:
[Oxide and Friends - Technical Blogging](https://oxide-and-friends.transistor.fm/episodes/technical-blogging)
and
[Screaming in the Cloud with Simon Willison](https://www.lastweekinaws.com/podcast/screaming-in-the-cloud/ai-s-security-crisis-why-your-assistant-might-betray-you/).
That's a muscle I would like to develop. Writing helps me document my journey as
I learn new things.
